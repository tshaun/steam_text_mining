10,Counter-Strike,"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though.",1,1,"['experience', 'type', 'review', 'saying', 'things', 'gameplay', 'suit', 'something', 'experienced', 'go', 'remember', 'back', 'friend', 'house', 'playing', 'know', 'name', 'internet', 'find', 'weeks', 'passed', 'another', 'friend', 'came', 'computer', 'brought', 'disc', 'told', 'games', 'moment', 'knew', 'going', 'saw', 'friend', 'house', 'saw', 'logo', 'filled', 'gamegasm', 'happy', 'playing', 'hardcore', 'made', 'friends', 'clans', 'involved', 'communities', 'even', 'made', 'two', 'first', 'played', 'competitively', 'experience', 'playing', 'public', 'servers', 'mods', 'fun', 'playing', 'competitively', 'made', 'intense', 'stressful', 'pleasant', 'way', 'ofcourse', 'looking', 'current', 'scene', 'might', 'seem', 'much', 'back', 'different', 'shooters', 'days', 'try', 'different', 'advanced', 'way', 'sometimes', 'simple', 'games', 'ones', 'live', 'day', 'also', 'plenty', 'mods', 'keep', 'attention', 'gameplay', 'simple', 'defend', 'attack', 'terrorist', 'plant', 'bomb', 'save', 'hostages', 'ct', 'sure', 'already', 'know', 'doubt', 'gamers', 'heard', 'know', 'gameplay', 'sharing', 'experience', 'wish', 'could', 'find', 'cs', 'anthology', 'account', 'lost', 'since', 'decided', 'going', 'buy', 'go', 'thousand', 'hours', 'played', 'still', 'day', 'brings', 'back', 'many', 'memories', 'sometimes', 'even', 'stumble', 'upon', 'people', 'played', 'years', 'ago', 'think', 'changed', 'gaming', 'major', 'way', 'would', 'many', 'games', 'today', 'would', 'exist', 'sure', 'many', 'people', 'already', 'played', 'games', 'cs', 'go', 'never', 'roots', 'doubt', 'hour', 'much', 'simple', 'differs', 'lot', 'opinion', 'cs', 'go', 'modern', 'games', 'harder', 'though']",0.1799460955710956,Positive

10,Counter-Strike,"Counter-Strike: Ok, after 9 years of unlimited fun with friends, I have finally quit counter strike. Counter strike, in all of its versions, its just a great FPS game that anyone can enjoy it.

10,Counter-Strike,"CS is one of the greatest and undermined games in history. It is, in my opinion, the best  game to ever have a crosshair. It is not a contact sport, so for the girly girls, it is an activity to indulge in.  It starts off with a team trying to kill another team.   I started playing cs when I noticed jacking off isn't the only activity to do on a computer. I started inviting a lot of friends out and getting drinks, as well as a boom box, to spend a nice summer day in the living room playing this wonderful game. I wanted to play every chance that i could. On my road of cs adventures, I encountered a couple of problems; those being that nobody was as fervent as I was about playing, and that when we did play, nobody was good enough, so it wasn't a lot of fun.  Then I discovered that I could sign up for a class with dboorn. I was overly excited, and signed up, but with skepticism at how the class was going to be. Sure enough, I was proven wrong. We started off by practicing a little bit. Then we split off into teams and started playing almost everyday of class. I made some friends, and played with people who had built up their skill gradually over the period of the course.  When I play counterstrike, the whole world disappears. Only I, the mouse, and my teammates remain. We are united in a common goal. We strive collectively towards an end we all desire. Each player has a spot to hold. They stand ready and waiting, eager for their chance to aid the team in what they hope will be a forthcoming victory. Thus, CS celebrates the unity of man, the indomitable spirit in all of us that pushes us and drives us towards excellence. When I play CS, I play until my veins pump battery acid, and then I play some more.  CS is unique among the games because it teaches all of us that no matter where we are in life, there is a role for us to play, and we can help our fellow man by fulfilling that role, and thereby our destiny. What destiny might you ask? I spoke before of unity. And it is that unity that brings us all together like one big loving family. That is the nature of counter-strike; the many working as one. One machine made of well oiled cogs and wheels, moving in unison, happy to play their part in the production of something greater than themselves. Not that these small metal objects are actually animate, I'm of course speaking only metaphorically.  Over the course of the years, I have increased in skill, but I have learned a greater lesson than how to be a better cs player. I have learned how to cooperate with a team to accomplish a goal that we all share. Even if that team is less than ideal. I have realized that cs is about more than just one's athletic ability. Instead, there is a deeper meaning behind the colt, the AK, the AWP, the deagle, the sands under my feet (in d2 or inferno). And more importantly, the teammates at my side. I love them. It is the human element of cs that gives cs its greatness.  In conclusion, I love cs. I love to win. I love pushing myself to my physical limits. It's that feeling that first drove me to the computer. For every second that I am not playing cs, there is only an unquenchable thirst to play. A thirst that grows as every minute passes by when I am outside, sitting at the television, or playing sports. I had an extraordinary time playing this game, and I will return to look at the future students of this game to see that bright eager look on their faces to remind me of how I used to feel. This review may be over, this game may be dead, but I will never stop playing couner-strike (1.6).",1,1,"['cs', 'greatest', 'undermined', 'games', 'history', 'opinion', 'ever', 'crosshair', 'contact', 'sport', 'girly', 'girls', 'activity', 'indulge', 'starts', 'team', 'trying', 'kill', 'another', 'team', 'started', 'playing', 'cs', 'noticed', 'jacking', 'activity', 'computer', 'started', 'inviting', 'lot', 'friends', 'getting', 'drinks', 'well', 'boom', 'box', 'spend', 'nice', 'summer', 'day', 'living', 'room', 'playing', 'wonderful', 'wanted', 'every', 'chance', 'could', 'road', 'cs', 'adventures', 'encountered', 'couple', 'problems', 'nobody', 'fervent', 'playing', 'nobody', 'enough', 'lot', 'fun', 'discovered', 'could', 'sign', 'class', 'dboorn', 'overly', 'excited', 'signed', 'skepticism', 'class', 'going', 'sure', 'enough', 'proven', 'wrong', 'started', 'practicing', 'little', 'bit', 'split', 'teams', 'started', 'playing', 'almost', 'everyday', 'class', 'made', 'friends', 'played', 'people', 'built', 'skill', 'gradually', 'period', 'course', 'counterstrike', 'whole', 'world', 'disappears', 'mouse', 'teammates', 'remain', 'united', 'common', 'goal', 'strive', 'collectively', 'towards', 'end', 'desire', 'player', 'spot', 'hold', 'stand', 'ready', 'waiting', 'eager', 'chance', 'aid', 'team', 'hope', 'forthcoming', 'victory', 'thus', 'cs', 'celebrates', 'unity', 'man', 'indomitable', 'spirit', 'us', 'pushes', 'us', 'drives', 'us', 'towards', 'excellence', 'cs', 'veins', 'pump', 'battery', 'acid', 'cs', 'unique', 'among', 'games', 'teaches', 'us', 'matter', 'life', 'role', 'us', 'help', 'fellow', 'man', 'fulfilling', 'role', 'thereby', 'destiny', 'destiny', 'might', 'ask', 'spoke', 'unity', 'unity', 'brings', 'us', 'together', 'big', 'loving', 'family', 'nature', 'many', 'working', 'machine', 'made', 'well', 'oiled', 'cogs', 'wheels', 'moving', 'unison', 'happy', 'part', 'production', 'something', 'greater', 'small', 'metal', 'objects', 'actually', 'animate', 'course', 'speaking', 'metaphorically', 'course', 'years', 'increased', 'skill', 'learned', 'greater', 'lesson', 'better', 'cs', 'player', 'learned', 'cooperate', 'team', 'accomplish', 'goal', 'share', 'even', 'team', 'less', 'ideal', 'realized', 'cs', 'athletic', 'ability', 'instead', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'behind', 'colt', 'ak', 'awp', 'deagle', 'sands', 'feet', 'inferno', 'importantly', 'teammates', 'side', 'love', 'human', 'element', 'cs', 'gives', 'cs', 'greatness', 'conclusion', 'love', 'cs', 'love', 'win', 'love', 'pushing', 'physical', 'limits', 'feeling', 'first', 'drove', 'computer', 'every', 'second', 'playing', 'cs', 'unquenchable', 'thirst', 'thirst', 'grows', 'every', 'minute', 'passes', 'outside', 'sitting', 'television', 'playing', 'sports', 'extraordinary', 'playing', 'return', 'look', 'future', 'students', 'see', 'bright', 'eager', 'look', 'faces', 'remind', 'used', 'feel', 'review', 'may', 'may', 'dead', 'never', 'stop', 'playing']",0.21257183908045976,Positive

10,Counter-Strike,"  Update to my review with some shameless advertising 05/10/2016:   Hey readers. I am now hosting a server on CS 1.6 where you can play and enjoy the fun experiences I did back in the day.   Map rotations vary from Vehicle, Aim, Surf, Knife, Defusal, and Hostage maps! IP Address: 173.199.73.78:27025     Review 21/10/2014:   I've played this game since I was around 6 years old back in 2002 and it still makes me laugh and have fun whenever I launch it to this very day. Over 12 years of endless entertainment. No other game on this planet has given me more entertainment and enjoyment than Counter-Strike 1.6 has and I doubt no game ever will.  Reason i've only got 38 hours here is because I no longer use the account I originally played cs 1.6 on.   func_vehicle is what makes this Counter Strike game the best out of all the others in the franchise.  Find a server that has car maps or maps with func_vehicle entities and you will have endless fun running over teammates and enemies in all kinds of hilarious and goofy vehicles not giving a care in the world.  You can drive a fork with a meatball on the end of it. Do i need to say more?  Mods on this game are amazing too. There is a mod where you can catch pokemon, level them up, train them and use their skills. Call of Duty mod that is suprisingly better than cod its self, Warcraft mods, zombie mods, basebuilder and so on...  There is even a map for the jailbreak gamemode that has driveable snowmobiles.   1337/10  Leet crew 5 lyf  Kicks csgo's ♥♥♥ by a mile. I forgot how good wallbanging is in this game.

For many, days were spent in front of the computer screen, manipulating the WASD keys with left hand and whirling the mouse with the right one. People yell and frown, they cheer and jeer as they team up their cyber-persona and pit them against another team. It doesn’t matter who won, who lost, who managed to kill to most of their opponents and who died the most, as everything will be scrambled up and reset when a new match begins. What is important is that, for those who are a part of the team, this computer game is their reality. These personas within the computer screen are their true identities. This is counter-strike.   Originally a modification (mod in short) made for Valve’s critically acclaimed Half-Life, Counter-Strike has gained much prominence since its initial launch. It is one of the first and definitely one of the most critically acclaimed multi-player computer games of all times. It is also the game used for many professional electronic sports competitions, such as ESEA League. Of course, this does not put Counter-Strike as a “professional only” game, as it has been enjoyed by many since its launch.  Getting started with Counter-strike is simple. You start off in one of the two teams: Counter-Terrorists or Terrorists. Before the round begins, you will have to purchase your own gun from the market, namely the famous AK47, M4A1, Desert Eagle, MP5, AWP and many more. Do not ask me why the counter-terrorists (namely the police) have to buy their own gun, and that they will have to go out with their lousy default colt pistols. Perhaps the government had some budget cuts and the SWATs have to buy their own guns. No one knows, but at least this will balance up the game. Also, you can equipment such as Highly-Explosive grenades, Flash-bangs (not recommend for beginners), smoke grenades, helmets and kevlars. You can also grab a defuse kit if you are playing on the side of the counter-terrorist, but normally we will steal that from dead teammates. Oh and you will be given a knife for free. Don’t worry about it, as most likely you use it to run instead of anything else.  The gameplay is fairly straightforward as well. There are quite a few number of game mods. The most frequently played ones are the Bomb Defusal maps, such as the all-time famous de_dust, the Hostage Rescue maps such as cs_assault, the VIP Escorting maps and the Kill Them All maps, such as the custom fy_iceworld and awp_map. Like all multi-player First Person Shooters, you will need good coordination and communication with your teammates if you want to win. Don’t worry about it though, because if you are new, just stick around and listen to what others have got to say. Just remember, you are not John Rambo, you only have 100 HP, and a stray bullet from a sniper rifle (AWP) will deal more damage than that.  As time press on, the mechanism of Counter-Strike became outdate. Of course, the legacy of Counter-Strike continues through its successors such as Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, Counter-Strike: Source, Counter-Strike Online (Asia only) and, the newest of all, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Throughout the years, Counter-Strike has evolved to become what it is today while its legend remains. Together with Half-Life and (maybe) Team Fortress Classic, Counter-Strike has not only helped Valve to thrive as a gaming company, but also defined what First Person Shooter should be.",1,0,"['load', 'go', 'go', 'hole', 'bomb', 'planted', 'win', 'uncountable', 'many', 'times', 'sentences', 'echoed', 'cybercafés', 'across', 'world', 'many', 'days', 'spent', 'front', 'computer', 'screen', 'manipulating', 'wasd', 'keys', 'left', 'hand', 'whirling', 'mouse', 'right', 'people', 'yell', 'frown', 'cheer', 'jeer', 'team', 'pit', 'another', 'team', 'matter', 'lost', 'managed', 'kill', 'opponents', 'died', 'everything', 'scrambled', 'reset', 'new', 'match', 'begins', 'important', 'part', 'team', 'computer', 'reality', 'personas', 'within', 'computer', 'screen', 'true', 'identities', 'originally', 'modification', 'mod', 'short', 'made', 'valve', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'gained', 'much', 'prominence', 'since', 'initial', 'launch', 'first', 'definitely', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'computer', 'games', 'times', 'also', 'used', 'many', 'professional', 'electronic', 'sports', 'competitions', 'esea', 'league', 'course', 'put', 'professional', 'enjoyed', 'many', 'since', 'launch', 'getting', 'started', 'simple', 'start', 'two', 'teams', 'terrorists', 'round', 'begins', 'purchase', 'gun', 'market', 'namely', 'famous', 'desert', 'eagle', 'awp', 'many', 'ask', 'namely', 'police', 'buy', 'gun', 'go', 'lousy', 'default', 'colt', 'pistols', 'perhaps', 'government', 'budget', 'cuts', 'swats', 'buy', 'guns', 'knows', 'least', 'balance', 'also', 'equipment', 'grenades', 'recommend', 'beginners', 'smoke', 'grenades', 'helmets', 'kevlars', 'also', 'grab', 'defuse', 'kit', 'playing', 'side', 'normally', 'steal', 'dead', 'teammates', 'oh', 'given', 'knife', 'free', 'worry', 'likely', 'use', 'run', 'instead', 'anything', 'else', 'gameplay', 'fairly', 'straightforward', 'well', 'quite', 'number', 'mods', 'frequently', 'played', 'ones', 'bomb', 'defusal', 'maps', 'famous', 'hostage', 'rescue', 'maps', 'vip', 'escorting', 'maps', 'kill', 'maps', 'custom', 'first', 'person', 'shooters', 'need', 'coordination', 'communication', 'teammates', 'want', 'win', 'worry', 'though', 'new', 'stick', 'around', 'listen', 'others', 'got', 'say', 'remember', 'john', 'rambo', 'hp', 'stray', 'bullet', 'sniper', 'rifle', 'awp', 'deal', 'damage', 'press', 'mechanism', 'became', 'outdate', 'course', 'legacy', 'continues', 'successors', 'condition', 'zero', 'source', 'online', 'asia', 'newest', 'global', 'offensive', 'throughout', 'years', 'evolved', 'become', 'today', 'legend', 'remains', 'together', 'maybe', 'team', 'fortress', 'classic', 'helped', 'valve', 'thrive', 'gaming', 'company', 'also', 'defined', 'first', 'person', 'shooter']",0.17321583178726033,Positive

10,Counter-Strike,"First starting off as a cute, little mod based on the GoldSrc engine, a heavily modified Quake engine, Counter-Strike's legacy continues to strife for a decade and a half over. Initially developed and released on top of a Half-Life modification, with the inspiration from the developer's strong theme and intriguement for military warfare and terrorism, the mod's success was immediately a marvel to behold; selling over 25 million units as a whole in the Counter-Strike franchise.  The maps and various scenarios set around the globe, players assume the roles of soldiers on two teams, counter-terrorists and terrorists. Both with a task, depending differently on the mission. Bomb scenarios, the terrorist team must plant a bomb, in a secured bomb location, while the counter-terrorists must fight back and ultimately defuse the bomb, if it may have been planted. Hostage scenarios is where the counter-terrorists must rescue a group of hostages being held by the terrorists. With both these modes, it has become a traditional campaign over time in different sequels.  The player, depending on what team they have been assigned to, can change their class into eight different character models, as well as buying weaponry and equipment, such as armour and grenades to help against the opposing team. As the round is about to begin, you're left in ''Freeze time'' that allows you to buy things with the money you earned by killing opponents the rounds before. This of course, gives players the time needed to choose wisely on what many strategies they will execute and whether it will be successful compared to your opponents.   This game is also highly customizable on the player's end.The game gives the options allowing for the user to either install or create their own custom skins, spray graphics, sprites, sound effects and HUDS that can be used in-game. I forgot to mention that modding is possibly one the biggest things that makes Counter-Strike such a versatile game to begin with.  I don't have much to complain about this game, other than it's become one of the biggest targets of hacking and cheaters, since its release. Aimbots, that auto-target other players while the player should naturally aim and shoot is just on of the many cheatings that players have executed. Wallhacks, that allows the player to see through walls through work by displaying objects that have translucent textures and can easily see targets through them, while the opposing team has no idea from their own perspective. To me, the cheating in this game is now more to do with experimenting than it is to do with cheating overall.   There's a different meaning when it comes to something that is outdated and old-school. Old-school is for nostalgic value, something that will guarantee to put a smile back on your face from all these past memories you've experienced and this is what the first title of Counter-Strike engulfs. Outdated, being something you don't particularly want to go back to, while there is the famous remake, Counter-Strike: Source, that runs on the more powerful and overly-recycled Source engine, allowing for better graphic and communication capabilities. Nevertheless, if you're looking for original flare that is burning in the Counter-Strike series, this game is definitely for you.  And to think, all of this success for the Counter-Strike series began as small little mod. Proof on how something so little, can create something so big.

It truely is a relief to play another shooter than CS:GO, without messing with your aim, movement, etc.  Just set everything up the way it is in CS:GO (sensitivity, key-binds, etc.) and escape from the austerity pressure to perform well in CS:GO. And RELAX theres nothing you can do wrong here. Even when there's a cheater, just don't give a f. I mean, there isn't even a stats-record. Like there's only a serversided stats-tracking if at all.
