42680,Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3,"It was sort of fun. Brainless, button mashing fun, but still some fun. If you want some no-thinking, fast-twitch nerve pumping, down a couple of Red Bulls and jump in.  Don't look for any tactical depth or decision making – this is strictly a console arcade game with nice set decoration. In tactics, somewhere between chickens with their heads cut off and rabbits mating.  Campaign is basically a tunnel you walk through with your NPCs getting in your way and saying things like, 'Frost! Charge in like a headless chicken, NOW!' (Hint, mostly ignore the NPCs). The story.... if you don't still believe in Santa Claus, you'll find it silly and implausible.  Ending was a series of HIT PAGE DOWN NOW! HIT B-O-T-H the RIGHT and LEFT mouse buttons NOW!  So prepare to yawn and roll your eyes.  Still, who doesn't like going for the head shot on the bad guys?  If you can get this one seriously on sale, and have run out of other games to play, could be worth it.  Can't recommend it at full price.  ",-1,0

42680,Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3,"It's a game with guns... pew, pew! Okay, i'm serious now, this game is amazing! The graphics are ok for the time, but the real thing is the gameplay.   You have a campaign continuing the things that happend in MW2, And also 4 dificulties. The dificulties are: Recruit, Regular, Hardened, and veteran. The dificulties have little mesages to: Recruit= For players who are new to first-person action games; Regular= Your abilities on combat will be tested; Hardened= Your Skills will be strained; Veteran= You will not survive.  You also have a Special ops witch includes survival! and you can play missions too.  The real fun is when you get a friend to play a friend to play over with you (Don't know if it works localy though) all the missions and survive with you. The survival is basicly you or your friend choses a map and then you get waves thrown at you (Not sure if wave limit exists though).   The multiplayer is what you expect from a call of duty game. Custom classes, game modes (A lot of them), killstreaks or scorestreaks and thats it. It improves allot on the multiplayer from MW2 bit i still find MW2's multyplayer fun.   The game is challenging in a good way, exept for multiplayer. Hackers rule in multiplayer while we are just a little guy getting killed over and over again, So heres some advice for InfinityWard: Add anti-cheat stuff! Anyways the game is good. Graphics: 7/10 Challenge: 8.3/10 Fun:8.5/10 Everything: 8.5/10",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"So, this game have poor graphics and it's really old, but it still awesome.  This game is based on strategy team work game, that's why i love Counter Strike games.  Yes ... almost all FPS are based on teamwork. But Counter Strike 1.6 is special, you play just for play (no rewards), here you can improve your teamwork to play other games, for example! Or you can simply kill players with no reason... The community have already sent some funny mods for this game and it's currently running in some servers you can join (Zombie Mode, Deathrun, Jailbreak,...). Repetitive? Well it depends on you, if you play all time in the same map in same gamemode, of course is repetitive, but if you make pcw(team/clan war) with your friends in alternated maps, the game will never be repetitive.",1,0

379720,DOOM,... ... ... Its a doom game... Doom games are fun. ,1,0
379720,DOOM,"From what I have played. I can tell you that i had a smile across my face the entire time. There are moments, that i feel are put in just for the original gamers to (in the midst of chaos) reflect on past moments, before being sucked back into insanity. DOOM1 had a awesome area in the intro map, where there was oodles of explosive barrels lined up for you to take out a room... well, DOOM 2016 throws this situation at you in a subtle way, and it absolutely took me back.   This game is the reason i got into gaming as a kid, and it is really good to see a fresh, modern take on sucha cult classic. I do not have pros and cons yet, but will update when i have finished the campeign. As it stands, i am very happy with my purchase.",1,1
379720,DOOM,"This is a fantastic game that manages to near perfeclty capture the frantic action of the orignal. Gone is the pseudo-horror adventure of DOOM 3. Instead, here we have an all action demon-slaying romp. If you're after that classic DOOM experience filtered through a modern visuals this game is it.   PROS:  + Near perfeclty captures the feel of classic DOOM + Loads of meaty guns that feel great to use + Combat system that rewards frantic run and gun action + Excellent finishing move system + Lots of hidden areas and secrets that make replaying the campaing fun + Beautiful visuals + Solid performance - managed to run a solid 60fps at high settings on a GTX770/i5 combo at 1080p  CONS: - Music is a bit bland - Story is very bare bones - at least it never gets in the way of the action - Not much variety in the levels - lots of red dust, rusty metal and shadows - Generic multiplayer mode feels sub-par comparied to most modern offerings - Occasionally disorientating level design due to everything looking a bit too similar  So there you have it. Its not sophisticated in any way. And it does not have that much variety. However, what it does it does very well indeed.",1,0
379720,DOOM,no iron sights in 2016 fps,1,1
379720,DOOM,"8 hours in. Oh yeah. The King of FPS is back. Fast, vicious, unforgiving, labyrinthian, ultraviolent gameplay. Secrets. Pickups. This is DOOM, kids. Drop your CoDs and your BFs, and come play what an FPS is REALLY about.  Great job id.  9/10",1,0
379720,DOOM,"Kampagne good, Multiplayer ok, SnapMap without 3 friends to play pretty much worthless,   8/10  Super Fun Combat, even more after you beat the Kampagne once and unlocked some demon runes, that make the combat faster  Update: Kampagne remains good but the MP is as bad as Snap Map, as Bethesda wants Doom to be seen as a complete pakage I would say its not a good one, the only reason this review is positive is because of the Singleplayer, I'm sorry for those who bought the season pass",1,0
379720,DOOM,"This game is a masterpiece, both technically and gameplay wise. You may or may not like multiplayer or Snap Map, but the single player experience is one of the best in the past decade. Just buy it.",1,0
379720,DOOM,"Pure FPS perfection, DOOM 2016 does pretty much everything right.   It captures the feel of the 1st and 2nd DOOM games perfectly. The combat is fast, brutal and just pure delight. Every weapon (well, maybe not the pistol so much) feels insanely fun to use, every enemy is satisfying to kill. The level design is great. On top of all that the presentation is stunning: the soundtrack is perfect, the graphics are unbelievable and it runs smooth as butter.  One of the best single player shooters of recent years, no doubt about that.",1,0
379720,DOOM,"Perhaps one of the best comeback games released in recent years, sans the multiplayer aspect. Single Player returning to Doom-past glory of just wonton violence towards demonic forces.",1,0
379720,DOOM,"Far better than it has any right to be.  It's amazing how keeping things simple and true to the DOOM 1/2 formulae somehow makes it feel fresh and new. Graphics are especially fantastic given how well it performs.  I'm not a huge fan of the art direction they chose, it seems like they gutted the gothic elements and made it very cartoony, but it grew on me over time. Small bits of humor in there make it clear they were not being very serious about it.   Combat in the game is fantastic, relying on constant movement to hunt demons. And you are the predator here, not the prey, which seems entirely intentional given other narrative bits in the game. The monster designs and feedback are exceptionally well polished and unique. I love the imp fireball charge. The base monster classes all operate very differently, something rare in games these days.  My only real complaint is the audio mixing is just bad. It's way too compressed, you can barely hear barrel explosions, and extreme ducking during events tends to cut out the (excellent) music. Physics effects seem to have no parameters for any sort of impact intensity and the smallest barrel refusing to settle makes continual annoying banging noises.",1,0
379720,DOOM,"This guy has no mercy! If you don't like DOOM, You are simply DOOMed.",1,0
379720,DOOM,"This game works as halo, and if you want to play halo with zombies then you're in for a lovely adventure. I've always wanted a halo pc game so it satiated me there. The game also will have lovely mod support, making it worthwhile.  Outside of that it's not actually a doom game and it barely works on pc with all the console optimization it has. Buy at your own risk.",1,0
379720,DOOM,"This is a true return to the olden days. DOOM is back with all the gory and glory of destroying demons. The whole package is well worth the price. To be honest the single player alone is worth the asking price.   DOOM’s single player is one of the best in recent memory. It truly trumps any FPS single player campaign of the new generation. There is no hand holding here. When you start you are thrown right into the action shooting demons right away. The progression and pacing is spot on and there is very little exposition and story here. You can find out more about the story through pda data. On the easier difficulties it can be too easy so I recommend starting out with the hardest difficulty you can. Once you beat it you can play on the highest difficulty and then you will have quite a challenge. There are a lot of secrets to be found and challenges to complete. You can also upgrade your armor and weapons and it is integrated in it seamlessly. But if you don’t like all the upgrades you can play it thru without upgrading anything and then you can have an extra challenge. The single player is truly a throwback to the old days.  Now then you have two more modes. First snap map. In snap map you can create your own levels. There are a lot of tutorials to help you get acquainted with the ins and outs. Creating levels is quite easy yet a little bit limited. But there are all kinds of options to create your own custom game modes for multiplayer to creating coop missions and single player maps. I am sure creative individuals will be creating quite the contend to keep you going back playing more of DOOM.  And then there is the multiplayer. Now the multiplayer is more akin to the olden arena shooters, but with modern tropes like loadouts and progression. The progressions is quite nice and for the most part you unlock cosmetics and at the beginning the weapons. All of the weapons you will unlock pretty quickly. The multiplayer is fun and hectic. But it’s not as good as the single player or snap map. It’s kind of in the middle. It’s definitely not the reason to buy DOOM. There is also a season pass for multiplayer content. But am not so sure the multiplayer will be relevant for long so it’s not really worth buying. Overall the multiplayer is casual fun but don’t expect it to hold you for long. And even tho the game isn’t long out there are already cheaters. And there is no anticheat system or anything so the cheaters ruin it just like every PC multiplayer game out there. The DLC season pass is also disappointing as it only includes multiplayer content.",1,0
379720,DOOM,"I absolutely love this game. there is nothing bad about this game except some little minor things that are missing her or there, let me just get straight into this.  the Single player is flawless, nearly flawless, it's fast paste, shot everything on sight, there is no stoping, yea, it has some moments where it takes tiem to explain, but they are extremely short and then back to killing everything! the game even starts with you already getting up and killing demons. And there are a big varitiy of guns, and each of those guns have a alt fire, so more power to killing demons.  and I know must of you ♥♥♥♥♥ed at the muliplayer but, Dooom isn't a muliplayer orianted game, this is the first muliplayer doom game(I don't count Doom 3, nor Xbox live arcade Doom).  pros of this game: -Singplayer is a must play -fast gameplay  -killfeast of demons -follows classic doom leveling sets -snapmap has a great map making editor  Cons of the game -muliplayer still sucks in a way -no browser search for games(both snapmap and muliplayer) -snapmap kinda on the low side as for people playing it   ",1,0
379720,DOOM,"Welcome to Hell. Return to the world of DOOM through a portal of blood. This reboot holds true to the old shooters of the 90s with no reloading, extreme fluid-like speed, and big ♥♥♥♥ing guns. The gunplay is phenomenal and really engages you into the rediculous, fast-paced onslaught of the demonic horde. It also holds true to the classic ways of secrets everywhere, and the majority of them actually being useful instead of just collectibles for the sake of collectibles.  A great homage to the classics and a refreshing first-person shooter playstyle that has fallen to the wayside over the years. 9/10.",1,1

I like the fact that the Main Character i am playing as doesnt speak, wears a helmet, and his character and personality is shown through his attitude and the way he acts. A real bad ♥♥♥.   I just wish there was more content in the storyline and some good in game cinematics. Its an old skool game with a retro style. Yes it is as if you were punching Satan in the balls. Doom is one of the best single player game out there that doesnt hold your hand.   There are occasional confusion when running around the maps and looking around for key cards. However this doesnt detract you from the real game, which is action pack and difficulty gets harder and harder as you progress. The end game is really worth it, you would have to use everything in your disposal and use every skill and effort to get through, its true hell.   Buy this game or atleast support it and have it in your library.Mind you that this game may cause disorientation because of the speed and pace, but when you get used to it, it doesnt effect you anymore.",1,0

570,Dota 2," Writing this for the “Love/Hate Relationship” community write-in qualifcation.   I just recently started playing DotA 2 as you can tell. I literally play every game there is with the group of friends I play with on (almost) the daily. Never played DotA 2 with them, however, until recently.   Always heard them talk about it, watched videos with them. Crazy stuff, countless possibilities, crazy combos. All requiring a good game-sense and immense skills when it comes to some heroes.  Never tried to get into it because I've played a lot of MOBAs (have a lot of knowledge on them) and I just didn't feel like getting into a new MOBA (to myself) that required me to learn a ♥♥♥♥-ton of heroes, their abilities, tactics &amp; strategies, techniques, knowledge on how to counter certain heroes, core builds, situational items &amp; just the store's items in general.  But lately, I've been feeling like taking up a challenge like that. I do not like playing a game being very unknowledgeable and possibly ruining the experience of others for the sake of my newbiness. As a new player, I try to play with a full-party being my friends. This means that, yeah, I'll mess up sometimes, but they'll be there to tell me what's right rather than bash me for doing what I did that was wrong. Even when we cannot play as a full-party, however, we happen to come across people that are understanding. Hard to believe, I know, I mean we do come across some toxic players, but hey, that's just inevitable in today's online gaming world.  But what if someone asks me, do I love or hate the game? What would my answer be?  I honestly love it &amp; hate it. It's situational. There are times when I do really good being up against heroes I can instantly learn how to counter and play against, while my friends brief me up on their abilities before I read them real quick in lane. But there are times when ever if I'm told exactly what they do and how to counter them, I just cannot. Some heroes seem like they have really short cooldowns on abilities/ults that should have longer abilities, items that they get to upgrade their ult, etc, all that. It just seems unfair sometimes.   But I know, I'm not one to talk when I just started playing the game, everything is probably there for a reason &amp; things cannot be 100% balanced but everything that I may think or claim is unbalanced or OP might just be normal when all this new knowledge is slapping my face.  I'll get used to it, eventually, I just hope I don't ♥♥♥♥ off a lot of teammates on the way.  I don't feed, I try my best not to, I usually don't end up with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ K/D ratio (except for the last few games). But this is my love/hate relationship with DotA 2. It's amazing, but it's really difficult. I love it... But I hate it?   Nevertheless, another great approach from Valve.  Zitten",1,0

378120,Football Manager 2016,"A longtime player and huge fan of the FM series, yet every year there seems to be one or more elements which can make the gameplay infuriating and unbearable. Before I list my complaints, I would like to emphasize that I have no problems with winning games, competions or creating working tactics and that these complaints are merely observations which cause a huge amount of frustration.  - Goalkeeper intelligence is laughable as they will frequently concede goals easily in their close corner due to terrible placement and movement. And even with frequent clean sheets, your goalkeepers (or anyone else) rating will rarely reach an average above 7.0.  -Defenders (particularly centrebacks) will track a player's run only to make 180 turn and run away from the attacker, which usually results in an easy conceded goal. And it doesn't matter whether you play as Bayern or Gateshead, because you will concede more than a fair share of goals from crosses at the far post, due the defender(s) inability/will to follow the run made by the attacking player.  - You will never/rarely actually get a goal, when you need one. Whether it's drawing level or winning a close encounter. And to pile on the misery, the opposition will also more than often score in the dying minutes, snatching either a draw or win.  - The aforementioned point makes the matches feel extremely predictable as you either absolutely smash opposition, go ninety minutes without a single chance or get the dreaded late conceded goal and all is visible/predictable due to the way your/opposing players move about on the pitch during the whole match/last minutes.  - Different tactical approach isn't as visible on-screen as one might imagine, which gives little incentive to create/tweak own tactics.  - Corner instructions are ignored (short corner instruction results in floating crosses being hit).  - Generally lack of new features with the exception of the terrible manager creator screen.",-1,1
378120,Football Manager 2016,"is Chelsea the richest/evil team in the world? As arsenal, everytime I bid a player, Chelsea bids him too.

370240,NBA 2K16,"I love sports games and had been looking forward to playing the Spike Lee story of 'Frequency Vibrations' for some time although basketball isn't my sport (September is normally saved for Fifa or Madden).  Initially I didn't recommend the game with early pre-release issues with lengthy loading times (which appear to be a part of the game) and frequent crashes which really hurt the immersion into the journey of Freq (these seem to have settled a bit).  As someone who purchased the game solely for the MyCareer mode I have now given it enough of a go after 11 hours to say the basketball is fantastic, the graphics amazing, soundtrack awesome and as such I can live with the terminally slow loading times (as slow as Ed Cowan was as Australian opener a few years back).  Playing a couple of high school and college games was pretty neat and I liked how the story mode through the first season kept player progression under control so Freq wasn't Rookie of the Year or an immediate All Star.  Having been drafted at #13 by the Suns, my Albert 'Freq' Timmerman enjoyed free agency negotiations and is now fighting to get his minutes up at the Bucks (getting 21 mpg at present and climbing along with his stats).  While I'll enjoy working on Freq, I will have to check out some other game modes now too :)",1,0

72850,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,"A half-decegame whose only redemption is the plethora of free third-party-content to remedy the otherwise buggy, half-finished, soulless, and lackluster world... now with microtransactions to purchase said third-party-content where the suits keep 70% to 100% of the profit for doing 0% of the work (apart from the buggy, inconsistent, half-working mess of a distribution system that is the steam workshop). Worse still, the third-party-content has no quality control, no checks to prevent theft and sale of others work, or any kind of a guarantee that the content will actually work, and if so, continue to work once you can no longer get your money back. Even worse than that, Valve/Bethesda stated that this is to 'support' the modders even though the modder only receives a maximum of 25% of profits providing that their mod accrues at least $400 of profit. With those restrictions, all this will support is buggy, half-finished, soulless, lackluster content, with an unreasonable pricetag to boot. Wait a minute, that sounds familiar...  Oh, but it's all optional, many say in response. To which I say, it is... for now, but if you stand idly by while blatant exploitation occurs for the benefit of making a few extra bucks at the cost of tearing an entire community apart, you can guarantee that things will only get worse. Less support for free mods, mayhap... perhaps even no support. And this will spread to other games in the same way that pathetic DLC did. Do you like endorsed day 1 DLC which companies are obligated to fix if it doesn't work? Get ready for third-party day 1 DLC that will inevitably break and never be fixed due to no obligations, and you won't get your money back. Didn't like having to wait for modders to patch Bethesda's games before? Get ready for big companies being even more lazy in their game development because 'The modders will fix it for us AND net us more money in the process.' It seems that companies want the players to develop their games for them while simultaneously paying the companies to do it.  TL;DR Paid mods are the bane of one of the greatest aspects of PC gaming. Take DLC, multiply it by hundreds or even thousands, remove all quality control, add an abundance of intellectual property theft, remove all guarantees of functionality and compatibility, and on top of that, possibly and quite likely remove any chance of a free alternative with the establishment of a monopoly on third-party content (that is purchase-only) in the future, and you will have paid-mods. If people give even an inkling of interest in this, it WILL spread, and we will have to kiss the days of being able to fix and improve our favorite games without simultaneously exploiting our very own friends and colleagues for the benefit of faceless, greedy corporations in our actions goodbye.",-1,0

72850,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,"Possibly one of the best games I have ever experienced in a while.  While its story is rather linear, some quests may seem repetitive, and its beautiful world filled with various bugs (such as the magical flying mammoths we all know and love), it is an extremely immersive and fun game to play. There are so many quests and RPG elements to make your character truly yours. Whether you want to be a cold blooded assassin, or a heoric paladin poised to rid Tamriel of evils, or even a sweetroll stealer, the possibilities are endless. With hours upon hours of questsing you may complete, alongside two great content filled DLC's, the time you will put into this game will be immense. Combat has been greatly improved compared to the previous Elder Scrolls games. Not only this, but the graphics still represent the beauty Skyrim has to offer.   All of this plus the potential of adding modifications makes this game truly addictive, and a great experience overall. I recommened this game to an Elder Scrolls fan, RPG fan, or anyone seeking to pour hundreds of hours into a game that will not fail to entertain. The opportunities and entertainment in this game seem to be endless, There is a reason as to why this 2011 game still ranks one of Steam's most played games today in 2016.

72850,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,"Well, I have owned and played every Bethsheda game execpt this one until recently. I was hesitant to purchase this game as I still have other RPG's yet to explore. I decided to atleast read some of the reviews and I must say I have never seen so many positive reviews about a game on steam. Of course with so may people raving about this game I decided to give it a try. As with other games in the Elder scrolls fanchise the endless play, do what ever you want, be whoever you want, stlye of game play is most appealing and much fun. The lack of game markers on quest makes it a little difficult at first but there is a spell, ability that corrects this after a few level up's. The quest are engaging and fun but the crafts and side quests are also great and so many that it can seem overwhelming at first. This game literally is 'endless' as many people have put 300+ hrs into the game and are still loyal and continue playing. This is a game that can keep you entertained for years. With the steam workshop there are hundreds of mods that can be downloaded and enjoyed so you never get bored and always find something new and challenging to do. I take my time with this game as it can literaly ruin your social life. And you find yourself playing for hrs at a time.

72850,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is built solely on the idea of discovery. In the very beginning you have no idea who you are, where you are, or why you’re aboard a carriage filled with condemned prisoners. All you know is you’re an outsider, and once you’ve reached your destination, your execution awaits.  The caravan arrives in the small forted village of Helgan, where you’re pulled from the carriage. Your captors fail to recognize you; they’re just as puzzled by your appearance as anyone else. Are you a man or woman, an Argonian or Breton? This is your first opportunity to ask yourself who you are and who you want to be in Skyrim; it won’t be the last time you ask yourself this.  Lucky for you, the execution fails, granting you an opportunity to escape Helgan. This is where Skyrim commences and where your story within Bethesda’s world begins. You’ve been told to visit a town not far north of your escape, but nothing other than the word of your new friend is there to compel you to visit it. The entire province is at your fingertips.  Skyrim is structured in a loose manner, allowing the player to discover its world and various narrative strands at the pace that they desire. Characters will tell you where you should go, but there is never any real urgency to do any of it. The world is cluttered with distractions and what makes this experience unique is the distractions form the very heart of Skyrim. The core narrative, as it is, is a mean to an end, an excuse to pilot you from one corner of the world to the other. It’s hard to imagine anyone following a single narrative strand when it’s impossible to travel from one quest point to the next without stumbling upon some sort of ruin, cave, encampment or fort. The narrative has its high points, but it’s always made secondary by the next undiscovered location on your compass; and that’s because Bethesda wants you to pave your own story.  Undiscovered locations dot the entire province of Skyrim, leaving the map a venerable piece of swiss cheese after a few dozen hours. Discoveries are the actual loot and tracking every single one of them down is the addiction that thrusts players headfirst into Bethesda’s fiction. Every location, small or large, is populated with its own personal story, which makes every journey feel special and rewarding. There’s an understanding that this world, this place, existed before you fell upon it; there’s also an unshakable feeling that it’s all been staged for you.  Skyrim would have you believe it’s a dynamic world that’s constantly in flux, when in reality it’s more like a car stuck in neutral, waiting to be put into gear. Characters go about their daily routines but they merely exist to bestow quests or impart dense records of lore; no-one is truly alive when you’re not engaged with them. One of the principal quest lines revolves around the Imperials and the Stormcloaks, two factions waging a purportedly bloody, savage civil war that has split the region in two. In each and every town across the land nearly every single person is happy to share an opinion on the war, telling you how dire the situation has become. But there is no war, no conflict, not unless you decide to take part in it yourself; you may see hundreds of random encounters in this Nordic land, but you’ll never see the ‘War for Skyrim’ unfolding.  Fiction aside, Skyrim is a vast, majestic world to discover. Bethesda is unparalleled when it comes to world building and when you’re wading through brooks, scaling mountains or eviscerating another cave full of bandits it’s an absolute joy. It’s a remarkable, liberating feeling that this province was crafted specifically for you; a huge playground with apparently no rules or boundaries. That isn’t the case. Skyrim has its rules; they’re specific and they have a nasty way of reminding you this fiction was written in binary.  Every city subscribes to a simple bounty system: commit a crime and you’ll be struck down, pay a fine, or spend the night in jail. There is a clear consequence to crime, but it’s merely an illusion. On my first evening in the town of Morthal I snuck into the Jarl’s house and then into the private quarters of her daughter, where I then attempted to pickpocket the young sleeping woman. Without the deftest of hands, the girl arose, alerting the guards of my treachery. Not wanting a fight or untimely death, I submitted, volunteering to pay my bounty and spend the evening locked up. The following morning, strolling from my cell, I bumped into the sleeping girl once more: she asked me to deliver a letter of utmost importance for her; she trusted me.  The bounty system is a dirty way to gloss over any real consequence for your actions. There is no gray area; everyone is either a friend or foe. When an enemy is nearly defeated they may beg for mercy, pleading with you to spare them. You can sheath your weapon but they will never flee, every single one will get up and rush you. Once, a villager followed me into a vampire’s hideout, hoping to avenge the death of his wife. Madness erupted and amid the scuffle I inadvertently grazed him with a fire spell, turning him immediately against me (note: the vampires who killed his wife were still very much alive). Afterward, instead of arriving to a town full of indebted villagers, I returned to an armed welcome and an outstanding bounty. There was no way to explain how the town learned of my accidental deed and no way to silence the vengeful widower – I tried killing him several times.  Once you’ve found the parameters that Skyrim works with, it’s not difficult to play by its rules, and even enjoy it. There is a huge, jaw dropping world to discover at whatever pace you desire. Along the way you’re free to author your own story, defining your unique character and experience through whatever style of play you prefer. When you’re lost in its rich landscape and enthralled within its fiction, Skyrim thrives, and is truly unparalleled; it’s when you take a closer look, you can’t help but discover the seams holding this tapestry together.

It will be impossible to know what is worth the price and what isn't, what will work together and what won't, and most of the mod content is stolen from other games and artists. How valve ever thought this was a good idea...  Avoid this trap.",-1,1
72850,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,"Gotta say, I found it atrocious that Valve has brought in paid mods on the community workshop. This has done irreperable damage to the skyrim modding community which has kept the game afloat all these years. I hope you're happy with yourself. I will never buy a mod. You should all be ashamed.   1/10 Guys",-1,1
72850,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,"Greatest game I've ever played! Skyrim changed my perspective on gaming as a whole, it's a work of art! From the second you create your character, you won't ever be bored again while playing. There's always something to do in Skyrim, always new quests, new locations, or dragons to slay, and the graphics are amazing!   Everything is great, and even though I feel that the NPC's could've been programmed a little bit better, it's nothing that doesn't make the game experience amazing. Best 60$ i've ever spent, and I would gladly have paid more. Buy it! :3",1,0

292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"Easily the best Action RPG I've ever played, 10/10. The combat leaves a bit to be desired, it's functional and average, but the story, setting, characters, and game world more than make up for it. Managed to clock 113 hours on 1 playthrough, and that was ignoring a lot of side quests, the monster nests, treasure hunts, etc. With 2 Titan Z's and 32gb RAM it runs solid 60 on maximum graphics, making it easily one of the most beautiful games I've ever had the pleasure of playing. Both DLC's as well feel more like Expansion Packs than your usual modern DLC, the first easily adding over 10 hours of new content, and the 2nd adding roughly 40. The first DLC also brings back the best girl in the entire Witcher series, Shauni for life! I would HIGHLY reccomend playing the first 2 games before picking up this one.",1,0
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"Game of the century. Vilgefortz approves.  Buy this game. Now. Or you would have mistaken the night sky for stars reflected in a pond.  Edit: Review updated after almost 200 hours and finishing the game on Death March (highest difficulty), before starting New Game +  The Witcher 3 : Wild Hunt is one of the best, if not the greatest open world RPG to date. It sets the benchmark for the genre, a standard so high that future developers have something to aspire to in terms of content.  CDProjektRed has put so much passion and inspiration into this masterpiece that it is evident in every single aspect down to the smallest details in this game. An example of this would be how they designed Kaer Morhen to look exactly like it was in the first Witcher game. Even the soundtrack played in Vizima castle is the same with the first game. And whenever we go to meet Vernon Roche in Temeria guerilla hideout (you guessed it) it's the same soundtrack for Temerians in TW2. Basically, for all Witcher game loyalists like myself, this game is a nostalgic walk down memory lane.  As for those book fans who have read the entire Witcher books, there are numerous nods for us too, from the talented female bard whose hauntingly beautiful voice reminds us of Essi 'star-eyes' Daven, to Fringilla Vigo; Geralt's trecherous side-♥♥♥♥♥ during his short stay in Toussaint. All in all a masterful tribute from CDProjektRed.  Everything was designed to enhanced your gameplay experience; from the unforgiving parry/dodge/roll timing and skill curve, to the renowned Bestiary system. Do not be turned off by the occasional drowner packs murdering you on death march difficulty; it is all part of the immersive combat experience. Every Gwynnbleidd starts from the bottom of the skill pile.  As been mentioned time and time again by other reviews, the new mini game 'Gwent' is one of the most addictive addition to the core game. You will easily sink a few hours into it just to finish the quests, or even more if you're one of the completionist type.  The story presents itself superbly well in a cinematic manner that you will not feel 'shoved to the right direction' since the whole narrative is unravelled in a subtle and very entertaining way. The sidequests are really fun, with their own backstory and are so numerous that you will sometimes have a hard time leaving an area to further the storyline.  There were some technical issues such as the achievements bug (which I was especially affected) but the devs team managed to sort it out after a few patches, and it's functioning again now (as of the date of this edit).  To conclude, I highly recommend this game for everyone who wants to feel appreciated by a game developer. They really appreciate you buying their game and it shows, in every aspect of this game. The end value and content of this product hugely surpass the amount that I paid for it, in this age where premium AAA titles sometimes valued at 10-20 hours base content, and I thank you CDPR. Keep it up. 11/10",1,0
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"The witcher 3 is the kind of games that either enlighten your day because of the real time growing beard of Geralt or worsen it because of being caled an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mutant for hours straight :c   (Besides that there is an outstanding storyline,diverse sidequests,awesome characters,a vast,rich open world to explore,a complete lore surrounding the entire Witcher series,atleast 100 hours of playtime and much more,but who cares about that?)",1,0

292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"I'm going to sound mean but, AMD sucks. Stop giving games bad reviews because AMD can't make a proper driver in time.  Game works properly, 1080p ultra settings on a GTX 780 overclocked. Update came out one day before the release. Besides the fact that vegetation looks like crap at the moment and the movement of it, seems chaotic and way too strong, this game is amazing, it's so complex and beautiful, I got lost for the first 3 hours and I didn't even kill the Griffin yet. This is one of those games you don't need to rush.  I'm dying at work now, waiting to go back for more. 11/10 overall, graphics could be better. Well optimized.",1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"16 hours into this masterpiece, and I still can't tear myself away from the starting zone. I want to savor every nook and cranny, explore every hollow, slay every monster. I've never felt this way about a game before. I keep wanting to push this game to its limits, and there really are no limits. I expected The Witcher 3 to feel a bit like Skyrim, but it is entirely different. Instead of laughing at the random glitches, watching close-but-not-quite-aweome animations, and occaisionally moving on to a new town becuase the old one is full of guards trying to kill you (at least that was how my game went), I find myself breathing in my surroundings, checking my map for markings that lead to new discoveries, and treking across a vast wilderness to find a foe worthy of one of my two swords.   And these foes ARE worthy. Combat is fast, smooth, and challenging. I'm playing on the second easiest difficulty (with plans to play Death March difficulty on a second playthrough), and I find myself studying my foes, scouting ahead, brewing potions to prepare, and approaching each adventure with caution. Skyrim was all about 'if its bigger than you, run like hell because you need better armor / weapons', while in the Witcher I can find ways to still beat them, like gathering ingredients to brew a potion that will give me an advantage, or using a specific rare bomb or weapon that will make the fight easier.  Apart from the general feel of the game, high quality shines like never before in this game. CD Project Red has put out the best RPG ever. Period. The story is so gripping, you will want to find the original novels to catch up on the lore, not because you don't understand the plot, but because you realize ITS THAT GOOD and you want more of it. As a gamer who has never played a Witcher game, nor read a Witcher novel, I've become an instant fan.   Finally, the committment to this game is amazing. Free DLC? Yes please. Expansion DLC that add 50 hours+ of new content? Done. Gwent? I have a new addiction.",1,1
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"After 85 hours of playtime, I finished the main game's story and many side quests, but the map was still full of question marks, so there was still so much left to do - the addons, Hearts of Stone and Blood &amp; Wine expand on the already awesome game so you get one of the most solid RPG experiences out there.",1,0
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"Best story based RPG yet? CD project red outdid themselves and everyone else with this one. With that said some of the problems are: 1. Extremely long, some people want this others don't so it may be a positive for you but for me its a minor flaw. 2. Combat is weak. Extremely floaty character movement (he does whatever the ♥♥♥♥ he wants based on what you press) ",1,0
292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"Okay, I'm not really sure where to start with this review, so I'll just jump right in. I'm only a few hours in (as of this review), and I have to say this is probably one of the best games I have ever played in my life. The graphics are absolutely stunning, while still getting around/above 60 fps. The story is intriguing and really pulls you in the middle of a war-torn land. Combat, while not being the best I've seen, is by no means bad (it's really good once you get the hang of it). Furthermore, getting to advance skills in either blades or alchemy is neat. I could just keep rambling on and on about this game, but I won't. My advice: BUY THIS GAME ASAP!",1,0

The world itself does not make Geralt, your main character, the only important character which truly speaks of how much immersive the game could be.
